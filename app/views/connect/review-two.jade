        p.well All the lights were on in my house. At 3AM, everyone should've been sleeping. I immediately knew something was wrong. "Mom?" I called from my bedroom. No reply. My heart started to beat out of my chest. What was wrong? Where was she? She always answered when I called for her. After moments of thinking through everything that could've possibly happened, I got up out of bed and opened my door slightly. No one was there. Now I was really worried. I frantically ran down the stairs only to find my mother sitting on the couch in complete silence. At that moment, I knew. She didn't even have time to get the words out before I burst into tears. My stomach dropped, my eyes swelled, and my mother embraced me. "Where's Dad?" I asked. "At the hospital. He made it just in time." Just in time to say goodbye to his mother forever. My beloved Grandmother had passed away suddenly. I didn't sleep for the rest of that night or for the rest of the week. Every time I closed my eyes I saw my Grandma blowing the candles out on her 90th birthday cake only days earlier. Behind my eyelids were only snapshots of my father crying -- something that I'd never seen before. I'd been to funerals before, but this one was different. This time I was sitting in the front row. The only comforting thing about the front row is that no one else can see your tears. At this celebration of life I realized I hadn't know much about my grandmother at all. To me, she was a brilliant, mature, and powerful feminine figure. But to others, she was a best friend, a sister, a mentor. Everybody had a different story about her. Whether it was the time she graduated from the first women's UCLA class or when she started the Beverly Hills Democratic Club, everybody had a fascinating story to tell.
