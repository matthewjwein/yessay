  h1 What is description?

block content
  p Description is so important to the college essay because it is through description that you pull the reader into your story. Think about it as a way of setting the scene. It is how you bring your memories to life, so that someone who was not there to experience them with you can see what you saw, feel what you felt. In this stage, only focus on getting down the details of the event. Don’t jump the gun and attempt to interpret the event. Just render it as evocatively as you can. And remember, you only have a paragraph or two to do so, which means you can’t capture the entirety of the event, only the moments that stand out most to you.

  h2 Sample 1
  p The waiting room was large and surprisingly unsanitary for a hospital. The television on the wall was running static. Or perhaps I only misremember it that way. The whole event is couched in so much confusion and haze that it’s hard to distinguish the way things were from the way I constructed them after the fact. I know for sure that my brother had been wheeled into the back two hours prior, and that we had not seen or heard a word from anyone since he had disappeared down that long corridor. My mother was crying. My father paced back and forth. When that army of uniformed hospital staff closed in around my brother’s gurney, we were simply edged out of the way. It would be hours before anyone came back around.
  h2 Sample 2
  p I was standing on the block, waiting for the gun. One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand. C’mon. Let’s move! The water gently lapped the side of the pool, tranquil and unassuming against the mounting energy of the breaststrokers, all of us, lined up waiting for that sound. The gun goes off. Within seconds, we hit the water. Long streamlined glide and then short, staccato strokes. Arms pulling down toward the body, then flying out again. Always reaching for the edge. I turn the first lap of the race. Our line has broken up. Some breaststrokers push to the lead, others linger behind. Natural ability and varying levels of practice stagger us in our lanes. And then, there’s the wall. It’s so close, I can already feel it. My hand reaches for it. Did I hit first? Did she hit first? Only a millisecond of difference.
