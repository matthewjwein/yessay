        h5 Waking up every morning at 5am to run before school takes a special kind of dedication. Not only does it make me a better runner, it is proof that if you want to excel at something, you have to work very hard to achieve it. You may even have to make some sacrifices. Although it is challenging to wake up that early every single morning, it is worth it every time I win a track meet.

The rush of adrenaline keeps me moving and pushes me through my exhaustion. I know that every track meet I win I owe to these early solitary mornings.
